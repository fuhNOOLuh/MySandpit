I created this file by ticking to create a README file when I created this repository in GitHub Desktop. I then clicked "Open in RStudio" which was already installed on my computer (this is where the video is talking about VS: Visual Studio, which is the programming application used in the video but we're using R). This text file then opened in RStudio and was blank. I entered this text and clicked save. Swapping back to GitHub Desktop, this same text is shown as the contents of the file. I then came back to RStudio to write this latter part, thereby editing the existing file. When I save it I expect that the text displayed in GitHub Desktop will update.

It took a second but it did update in GitHub Desktop.
